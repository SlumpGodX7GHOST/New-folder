                                        structures using processes that are environmentally responsible and
                                        resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle from sitting to design,
                                        construction, operation, maintenance, renovation and deconstruction. Green
                                        building is also known as a sustainable or high performance building.
                                        <br>
                                        Green buildings in the hotels are designed to reduce the overall impact of the
                                        built environment on human health and the natural environment by:
                                        <br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources</li>
                                        <li> Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity</li>
                                        <li> Reducing waste, pollution and environmental degradation</li>
                                    </ul><br>
                                    For example, green buildings may incorporate sustainable materials in their
                                    construction (e.g., reused, recycled-content, or made from renewable resources);
                                    create healthy indoor environments with minimal pollutants (e.g., reduced product
                                    emissions); and/or feature landscaping that reduces water usage (e.g., by using
                                    native plants that survive without extra watering).

                                    <br>
                                    </p>

                <p class="u-text u-text-2"> However, In the current competitive hotel industry, are green buildings
                    really advantageous? And does the hotel industry really require green building designs? If yes, how
                    does it influence tourists’ choice of hotel accommodation? Does green building persuade customers to
                    recommend the hotel to their friends?
                    <br>
                    The simple answer is yes!! Today's consumers are more eco-conscious than ever. They demand that
                    brands adopt sustainable solutions, such as getting rid of single-use plastics like straws and
                    shopping bags and businesses that fail to adapt may find customers visiting their competitors.
                    <br><br>
                    Sustainability is an essential trend in the hospitality industry. Some 19% of travelers said they
                    would pay more for a vacation with a green electricity resort. Consumers are becoming more aware of
                    their carbon footprint, and are taking steps to reduce it - including opting for eco-friendly
                    travel.
                    <br><br>
                    Apart from the consumer behavior, green building initiatives while being good for the environment,
                    also come with a financial gain. Sustainable hotels have lower operating costs, and they command
                    higher building values while receiving tax breaks and incentives.
                    This is the reason why many hospitality brands are moving towards green and sustainable construction
                    as a ground-up solution.<br>

                <p class="u-text u-text-1"> Over the past decade or so, Indian hoteliers have started taking a serious
                    note of the need for ‘greening’ their hotels and operations. India has the third largest number of
                    LEED-certified hotels and the largest number of LEED Platinum hotel projects in the world. Even
                    hotels that have already achieved LEED at the design stage are now going for LEED Operations and
                    Maintenance (O+M) certification to further highlight their efficiencies and demonstrate their
                    continued commitment to sustainable performance.
                    <br>
                    As places of relaxation and respite, hotels should inherently focus on the health and well-being of
                    their occupants. Green buildings not only deliver on both these counts but also go further by also
                    improving the productivity and happiness of employees.<br>

                <p class="u-text u-text-1" style="padding-top:60px ;"> Hotels and other hospitality venues have a
                    significant opportunity to reduce negative environmental impacts associated with guest rooms, event
                    space, and general facility use through measures such as energy and water efficiency, waste
                    reduction and management, sustainable and local purchasing, and use of alternative transportation.
                    <br>
                    Hotels consume natural resources at an extraordinarily high rate, as they are occupied 24 hours a
                    day, seven days a week. According to a Trip Advisor survey, nearly two-thirds of travelers reported
                    plans to make more environmentally friendly choices over the next year. And while on vacation, 88 %
                    of travelers turned off lights when not in their hotel room, 78 % participated in the hotel’s linen
                    and towel reuse programs and 58 % used recycling in the hotel. As guests demand more sustainable
                    travel solutions, hotels are positioned to deliver high quality experiences with the help of tools
                    like LEED, that positively impact human health and the environment.
                    <br>
                    Also, Incorporating LEED includes sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency,
                    materials selection and indoor environmental quality.

                <p class="u-text u-text-1" style="padding-top:60px ; padding-bottom: 40px;"> The hospitality industry is noticing a change in
                    consumer behavior. Consumers are requesting sustainable resources, evaluating the indoor environment
                    for health concerns and placing a preference on sustainable buildings. As this trend continues,
                    consistent metrics and standards to support the quality of product the hospitality industry delivers
                    will become even more important for a variety of stakeholders, including owners, investors and
                    operators. Integrating green building strategies into the design, construction and daily operations
                    of hotels makes business sense and can be an important part of a company’s commitment to
                    sustainability.
