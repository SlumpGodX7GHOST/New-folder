                                        Day of the African Child has been celebrated. It was through great effort when
                                        in 1976, ten thousand black children marched in a column to protest the poor
                                        quality of education provided to them and demanded improvements for the same and
                                        a right to be taught in their language. Since then from 1991 onwards the
                                        Organization of African Unity commemorated the efforts of these children and
                                        their zeal to celebrate 16th June as The International Day of the African Child.
                                        In Soweto, South Africa, on the 16th of June 1976, nearly ten thousand children
                                        marched together to protest the Black Education Act. The Black Education Act was
                                        a means to control was used as a segregation method and was a Southern African
                                        segregation law that legislated for several aspects of the apartheid system. Its
                                        major provision enforced racially-separated educational facilities. Its major
                                        provision enforced racially-separated educational facilities. This act was
                                        focused on training the children in manual labor and menial jobs that the
                                        government of that time thought were deserving to the natives, separating them
                                        and explicitly exploiting them and making sure to also marginalize and hold back
                                        Black and force them to accept being subservient to the white South Africans.

                    High schools were initially concentrated in the Bantustans, reserves that the government intended as
                    homelands for Black South Africans. However, during the 1970s the need for better-trained Black
                    workers resulted in the opening of high schools in Soweto, outside Johannesburg. Nonwhite students
                    were barred from attending open universities by the Extension of University Education Act (1959).
                    The Bantu Education Act was replaced by the Education and Training Act of 1979. Mandatory
                    segregation in education ended with the passage of the South African Schools Act in 1996, but
                    decades of substandard education and barriers to the entrance to historically white schools had left
                    the majority of Black South Africans far behind in educational achievement by the beginning of the
                    21st century. The taxes paid by the communities that these people served were used as funding for
                    the schools, and only a small amount of funding was given to these schools. As a result, there was a
                    profound shortage of qualified teachers, and teacher-student ratios ranged from 40–1 to 60–1. An
                    attempt by activists to establish alternative schools (called cultural clubs because such schools
                    were illegal under the education act) that would give children a better education had collapsed by
                    the end of the 1950s. To help these children who are still deprived of good educational centers in
                    these areas celebrities have made sizeable donations to develop the quality of educational care
                    provided. Most notably Oprah Winfrey established a school in the Henley on Klip, Gauteng Province,
                    South Africa, namely, Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls. This school project began after
                    she had a discussion with the South African president of the time Nelson Mandela in 2000. The school
                    started operating in 2007 and 72 girls graduated in the year 2011. Inspired by her disadvantaged
                    childhood, Winfrey stated that she founded the Leadership Academy to provide educational and
                    leadership opportunities for academically gifted girls from impoverished backgrounds in South Africa
                    who exhibited leadership qualities for making a difference in the world. She wanted to help girls
                    who grew up like her, "economically disadvantaged, but not poor in mind or spirit".
<br><br>
                    This act was humbly praised by Nelson Mandela - The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for
                    Girls—located near Johannesburg and educates girls in Grades 7 through 12—is, therefore, a
                    wonderfully appropriate gift to the people of South Africa, one that will endure over many
                    lifetimes. When I went to the opening of her school, I looked at the shining faces of these young
                    women and thought every one of them has the potential to be an Oprah Winfrey. The school is
                    important because it will change the trajectory of these girls' lives and it will brighten the
                    future of all women in South Africa. Oprah understands that in Africa, women and girls have often
                    been doubly disadvantaged. They have had the curse of low expectations and unequal opportunities. -
                    Nelson Mandela quoted in Time
<br>
                    Even though soo much has happened still, 57 million primary school-age children are currently out of
                    school, and over half of these are from Africa. The call for universal education from The United
                    Nationals is still an important task that needs to be accomplished for every child in Africa. 10,000
                    students on 16th June 1976 marched on the streets and sacrificed their lives on during Soweto
                    Uprising in South Africa for their right to an education. Thousands of students were badly injured
                    during these protests. In the following 2 weeks, hundreds of students were shot and hundreds were
                    killed. The day of the African Child also holds an opportunity to raise awareness of the need to
                    improve awareness of the education standard of every child living in Africa. Since 1991, the Day of
                    the African Child has been celebrated on June 16 to commemorate those killed during the Soweto
                    Uprising in South Africa and to recognize the courage of the students who marched for their right to
                    an education. 57 million primary school-age children are currently out of school and over half of
                    these are from Africa.
