                                        in your toiletry bag, there are many steps to follow along this path. A lot
                                        happens, from brainstorming and product development to packaging design and
                                        marketing mock-ups. And sometimes that includes animal testing. Studies have
                                        shown that animal tests only correctly predict human response to cosmetics
                                        40-60% of the time, while alternatives are accurate 80% of the time. Animal
                                        testing is not only ineffective, but also expensive. However, in 80% of the
                                        world's countries there are still no laws against animal testing on cosmetics.
                                        The Body Shop wants to change that with its Forever Against Animal Testing
                                        campaign.1 Launched last June, it has garnered 4.1 million signatures since
                                        then, making it the largest campaign ever for the cause. Once they reach their
                                        goal of 8 million, they will petition the United Nations with their campaign
                                        partner Cruelty Free International2, the leading nonprofit organization
                                        advocating for an end to animal testing, to create an international convention
                                        banning the conducting animal tests. “A few years ago we surveyed clients in six
                                        different countries around the world and asked them what topics mean the most to
                                        them and animal testing is the most popular topic that really interests our
                                        clients, which makes sense because we were our first brand in address this
                                        issue,” said Jessie Macneil Brown, director of global campaigns for The Body
                                        Shop.

                    trends around the demand for cruelty-free, vegan and vegetarian beauty products and that 80% of
                    governments still don't have bans on experimentation with animals in cosmetics. You think that as
                    activists we can do something. We had our last campaign against animal testing in 2013 when the
                    European Union introduced its ban. It really is proven that one of the largest non-animal cosmetics
                    markets in the world can innovate, prosper and grow without animal testing. "

                    January 23, The Body Shop and Cruelty Free International are running the world's first animal
                    protest in front of the United Nations headquarters in New York City. The protest included eight
                    dogs of various breeds and sizes, as well as protest posters and banners. They were joined by
                    wildlife influencer and photographer Elias Friedman of TheDogist,3 who previously supported the
                    campaign in the US and Canada, and canine influencer louboutinanyc4, also known as the New York

                    home," says Friedman. “For most people, it is probably easier to identify with dogs than with
                    laboratory rats or other animals. We help animals to have the voice they don't have. The Forever
                    Against Animal Testing campaign5is about something important and simple: no animals are required to
                    test cosmetic products. There are humane alternatives that cosmetics companies should use instead. "

                    important that all countries ban cosmetic animal testing to prevent testing from simply being

                    share it with your circle. If you believe in cruelty-free products, you are only supporting the
                    brands that make them. And there are many who do, from indie to global giants. Physicians Formula6
                    has always been a cruelty-free brand committed to working with third-party vendors who share this
                    philosophy, as has the global brand IsaDora7, which was recently launched in the United States.
                    Urban Decay has been cruelty-free since its launch in 1996 and was the first brand to offer luxury
                    makeup brushes that were completely synthetic. In 2006 it became the first prestigious brand with an
                    online vegan shopping area. They partnered with PETA to create their first fully vegan eyeshadow
                    palette to mark their 25th anniversary, raised funds for the Humane Society of the United States,
                    and sponsored the Genesis Awards, which recognize the media for reporting on animal welfare. Last
                    year, Urban Decay hosted a dog food festival on National Dog Day in London's West Hollywood last
                    year to celebrate cruelty-free, with puppy massages, gourmet dog treats, professional dog portraits
                    and booties like the custom branded straps, tennis balls and bandanas. Urban decay. They also just
                    started their first influencer collaboration with Kristen Leanne, an advocate who only supports
                    cruel brands on her Instagram. Then there's Lush, who has campaigned across the industry for over
                    thirty years to combat the animal testing they report in their stores and on their shopping bags.
                    They host the Lush Prize,8 a global awards ceremony where the company's founders give money to
                    researchers working to find alternatives to animal testing; They have awarded nearly $2 million in
                    prizes since 2012.

                    “Like individual food allergies, we can all react differently to topical agents. And a product
                    tested on an animal will not produce the same result on a person. The practice is out of date and
                    does not guarantee safety. We prefer the use of ingredients and products that have been tested on
                    volunteer subjects so that the life and quality of life of animals can be saved, and the products
                    have a more accurate safety result when used by humans. It is a profit for humans and animals to
                    stop animal experiments. The decision to buy only cruelty-free products can have a big impact.
                    Aligning with your dollar is ultimately what makes the biggest companies make changes."

                    Some beauty companies dedicated to this cause have raised funds and attention through their
                    products. In addition to ensuring that all Kat Von D Beauty are vegan and cruelty-free, vegan Kat
                    Von D supports animal rights through her volunteer work with organizations like Farm Sanctuary, an
                    animal welfare organization that was the first shelter of animals of the United States. The brand
                    released four special editions of its best-selling Everlasting liquid lipsticks in the aid of Farm
                    Sanctuary,9 each named after real animals there. Too Faced is also cruelty-free and donated $

                    Thanks to these efforts, the industry begins to develop. “Now we have seen a lot of momentum from
                    other governments; Brazil, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Korea and Australia are implementing
                    laws against animal testing,” says MacneilBrown. “We see countries around the world moving in that
                    direction, so the momentum is there. When an animal is tested, it does not leave this laboratory and
                    is completely unnecessary. It is more expensive, less accurate, and not as efficient. Animal testing
                    is not really required and we just need everyone to keep up with the new technology so that we can
                    do cheaper, faster and more accurate tests. "Technological advances have brought alternatives to
                    animal testing, including computational analysis, human patch testing, or laboratory skin. There is
                    a growing number of alternative tests that mean products are still safe and companies can still
                    innovate, and we want to make sure this continues and that regulators everywhere have access to
                    these tests," says Thew. “And we know what consumers want. Consumers around the world are choosing
                    cruelty-free options and urging decision makers to stop testing on animals. We are seeing more and
                    more countries move, so now is the time for everyone to work together to end this once and for all.
