                                        for brands to turn to more sustainable solutions. It is commendable that
                                        organizations globally are engaging and implementing programs and initiatives to
                                        prioritize sustainability.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Brand Sustainability is a wonderful concept that has the potential to not only
                                        drastically change the world but bring massive awareness to global, social, and
                                        environmental issues. But being sustainable isn’t something that can be done
                                        overnight. Even though many companies are convinced that becoming
                                        environmentally friendly will erode competitiveness, they also fear that it will
                                        add to costs and not deliver immediate financial benefits.
                                        <br><br>
                                        CEOs of big companies fear that switching to sustainability or developing
                                        “green” products will place them at disadvantage. As it’ll be difficult for
                                        suppliers to provide transparency or green inputs; new types of equipment will
                                        be required for sustainable manufacturing and consumers will be reluctant to pay
                                        more for eco-friendly products during a recession. Making it one of the reasons,
                                        most executives treat the need to become sustainable as a corporate social

                    As was foreseeable, the fight to save the planet has turned into a high-pitched battle between the
                    government, companies, and consumer activists. It is difficult to bring all three of them on one
                    single page. Government initiative towards sustainability is less. To solve this issue more and
                    increasingly tougher regulations should be implemented on the government's part. Knowledge about
                    sustainability, carbon emission, climate change is less among consumers, hence consumers should be
                    educated so they will force businesses to become sustainable.
<br><br>
                    One of the biggest roadblocks for companies and brands that already invest in sustainability is the
                    lack of systematic incentives or framework to engage in sustainability and the lack of available
                    information. Companies that are reluctant to invest in sustainability state the lack of awareness of
                    benefits and little to no understanding of the business case for small/ medium brands, not enough
                    support services to guide and support implementation, and a lack of knowledge on environmental
                    issues end up becoming roadblocks in switching to sustainability.
                    <br><br>
                    Another roadblock that companies often face is how to reduce or calculate waste and emissions. Most
                    large companies induce suppliers to become environment-conscious by offering them incentives.
                    Companies can detect waste sources by using tools like corporate carbon management, carbon and
                    energy footprint analysis, and life-cycle assessment. Life-cycle analysis is very useful: It tracks
                    the environmental inputs and outputs of whole value chains, from raw materials to product usage and
                    returns. Managing workplace data can pose a roadblock for some companies.
                    <br><br>
                    Following a paperless approach is not as difficult as it seems. Sustainability has the potential to
                    lead to innovative next-practice platforms. At the junction of the internet and energy management,
                    one is forming. Through meters, sensors, and applications, companies will be able to optimize the
                    energy use of computers, network devices, machinery, telephones, and building equipment by using
                    digital technology to manage power generation, transmission, and distribution from all types of
                    sources, as well as consumer demand. It will also allow for the creation of cross-industry platforms
                    to manage the energy needs of cities, businesses, buildings, and individuals. Cisco, HP, Dell, and
                    IBM are among the technology companies that are already investing in the development of these
                    platforms.
                    <br><br>
                    According to Harvard Business’s research sustainability is a mother lode of organizations and
                    technological innovations that yield both bottom-line and top-line returns. Becoming environmentally
                    friendly, instead of increasing the costs, lowers them. As companies end up reducing the inputs they
                    use. Moreover, the process generates additional revenues from better products or enables companies
                    to create new products.
                    <br><br>
                    Many big companies have benefitted by switching to a sustainable approach. For Instance, in the
                    early 1990s Hewlett- Packard( HP) understood that lead is toxic and the government would one day ban
                    lead solders. Over the following decade, HR experimented with various alternatives for lead, and by
                    2006 was successful in creating solders that are a blend of silver, tin, and copper and developed
                    chemical agents to tackle the issue of oxidation and tarnishing during the soldering process. This
                    HP was able to comply with the European Union’s Restrictions of Hazardous Substances Directive,
                    which regulates the use of lead in electronic products, as soon as it took effect in 2006.
                    <br><br>
                    Contrary to popular perception sustainability can actually save companies money. What brands and
                    companies need to understand about sustainability is that roadblocks to sustainability are just
                    mental roadblocks. Deeply rooted myths that should be broken. If businesses adapt to green practices
                    they can bring enormous changes. To summarize, sustainability is a big concern that affects more
                    than just individual businesses. However, a number of significant corporations are implementing
                    forward-thinking environmental practices, which is encouraging. It is definitely becoming evident
                    that sustainability is a megatrend that simply isn’t going away!
