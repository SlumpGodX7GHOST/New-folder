                                    <p class="u-text u-text-1">&nbsp;When big banks started failing across Wall Street
                                        and the housing and stock markets plummeted in 2008, the world realized how
                                        important financial regulation is for economic stability – and how swiftly the
                                        effects can cascade throughout the economy when regulators are asleep at the
                                        wheel. Climate change has a drastic altering effect on the global economy.
                                        Despite Wall Street jokes about the weather being a terrible excuse for bad
                                        economic data, climate change is now plainly fast enough to alter economic
                                        forecasts. How long until projecting GDP is largely, if not entirely, dependent
                                        on projected weather patterns?
                                        <br><br>
                                        These issues are already on the minds of officials. Various government and
                                        corporate organizations have attempted to model the economic implications of
                                        climate change. Climate change is a significant economic threat today. Once
                                        again, how financial regulators and central banks respond will have a big impact
                                        on how much it incapacitates the economies. In 2015, former Bank of England
                                        governor Mark Carney listed a number of climate-related hazards that might
                                        disrupt the financial system. Extreme weather costs are rising, while lawsuits
                                        against firms that contribute to climate change are dropping in value.

                    Nobel Laureate and American economist Joseph Stiglitz concurs. He argued that a sharp increase in
                    carbon prices – which governments levy on companies for emitting climate-warming greenhouse gasses –
                    could spark a new financial crisis, this time centered on the fossil fuel industry, its suppliers,
                    and the banks that finance them, with consequences for the rest of the economy.
                    <br><br>

                   <h4> Why does Climate Change pose a risk to the financial system?</h4>
                   <br><br>
                    Climate change poses a systemic risk to the financial sector, which necessitates increased
                    regulatory monitoring and mitigating actions. Systemic risks in the financial system are hazards
                    that have the potential to destabilize the system's normal functioning and have major negative
                    effects on the actual economy. At least two types of climate-related hazards cross this threshold:
                    <br><br>
                    1) Physical risks connected with more frequent extreme weather events and long-term environmental
                    changes
                    <br><br>
                    2) Transition risks associated with the policy and technology reforms required to establish a
                    greener economy.
                    <br><br>
                    Carbon-intensive assets could be stranded, and the value of other financial instruments could be
                    affected. The massive amount of predicted losses owing to physical and transition risks, as well as
                    the potential for those losses to occur quickly, could have a devastating impact on systemically
                    significant financial institutions and broader financial markets. Importantly, financial
                    institutions are not only exposed to the physical and transition risks posed by climate change, but
                    they are also actively amplifying those risks by continuing to fund activities that exacerbate
                    climate change. Between 2016 and 2018, the six major US Wall Street banks committed over $700
                    billion to fossil fuel financing. According to a 2016 poll, the top insurers had $528 billion in
                    fossil fuel investments, and the top asset managers had boosted their ownership of assets linked to
                    carbon-intensive industries by 20% in the last few years.

                    <br><br>

                   <h4> Physical Risk</h4>
                   <br><br>
                    Increases in the frequency and severity of damaging floods, droughts, fires, and hurricanes, as well
                    as rising sea levels, can result in destabilizing losses for insurance companies, banks, and other
                    financial intermediaries with direct and indirect exposure to various affected industries and
                    assets. Stress at a large, sophisticated, and interconnected financial institution—a systemically
                    significant firm—or correlated stress among smaller enterprises all facing the same risks could
                    spread stress throughout the financial system. Between 2016 and 2018, the United States was hit by
                    45 natural disasters, each costing at least $1 billion. Natural disasters caused an average annual
                    economic loss of around $150 billion over the same time period. In comparison to previous decades,
                    this represents a significant rise in both severity and frequency. From 1980 to 2019, there were an
                    average of six natural disasters per year that generated more than $1 billion in damage, with total
                    yearly natural catastrophe losses of just under $50 billion.
                    <br><br>


                   <h4> Transition Risk</h4>
                   <br><br>
                    Aside from these physical dangers, the financial system could be destabilized by very quick losses
                    in carbon-intensive assets as a result of the urgently needed transition to a greener economy.
                    Carbon-sensitive assets in the utilities, energy, transportation, industrial, and other sectors
                    could lose value if policymakers took the necessary steps to decarbonize the economy, or if
                    technical advancements made that move financially advantageous. Such action or innovation might
                    dramatically raise the price of carbon, stranding certain fossil fuel assets and lowering the value
                    of other carbon-sensitive assets. One estimate puts the current value of possible losses at $18
                    trillion, based on a broad assessment of stranded assets, not only those directly in the fossil fuel
                    sector. Adam Tooze, a history professor at Columbia University, estimates carbon-sensitive
                    industries are responsible for up to one-third of all equities and fixed income assets. By enhancing
                    the financial system's resilience, financial regulatory measures are designed to reduce both the
                    likelihood and severity of disruptive crises. It's past time for policymakers to implement bold
                    regulatory and supervisory measures to ensure that the financial sector is ready to securely handle
                    the physical and transition risks posed by climate change. Mitigating the financial stability
                    consequences of a quick transition may also make policymakers more likely to execute the essential
                    transition steps in the first place.

                    <br><br>

                    Climate change poses a threat to the financial system's stability, and thus falls under the purview
                    of financial authorities. They must recognize the emergence of systemic risk and take efforts to
                    strengthen financial institutions and markets' resilience. Delaying action will only increase the
                    chances of a climate shock disrupting the financial system and having a significant impact on the
                    broader economy.
