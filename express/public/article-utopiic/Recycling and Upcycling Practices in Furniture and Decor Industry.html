                                        in the world we live in today. Almost all the manufacturing sector is trying
                                        very hard to meet the recycling norms in order to please their customers. Major
                                        global brands like Amazon1 and Starbucks2, both of which are based in Seattle,
                                        are in the news for incorporating more and more recycled resources into their
                                        operations and to support sustainable initiatives. The people in the big
                                        furniture firms have noticed this trend and have increased their share in
                                        recycling by using recycled plastics, wood and metals while creating their
                                        products. Upcycling and use of vintage pieces is very popular all over the world
                                        and has been so for many years. Keeping this vision in their mind the furniture
                                        industry is coming up with new and innovative ways to bring in more recycled and
                                        reclaimed materials at the core of their mission. Keeping the illustrations of
                                        upcycling the industry overall has realized that there is already an abundance
                                        of usable materials and this is making the furniture companies create and manage
                                        their very own circular economy.

                    to make sure industries form a circular economy and hence creating recycled products becomes a
                    criteria of utmost importance for European companies like Pentatonic.3 The current catalog of the
                    company has a wide range of products like chairs, tables, pillows and other products from post
                    consumer waste and are built in such a way that someday they can be recycled again. Apart from that
                    many of their products are made by using recycled plastic, a material which the co-founders Jamie
                    Hall and Joe Boedecker believe has a lot of untapped potential.

                <p class="u-text u-text-1"> One report says that almost 480 billion plastic bottles were purchased in
                    the year 2017 itself and the cofounders of Pentatonic are making a point that they use this excess
                    plastic in their raw materials. One of the best parts about this plastic is that it is pliable and
                    flexible and hence the people at Pentatonic can use the polyethylene present in the plastic (PET) to
                    make upholstery and seatings. They have also formed collaborations with waste management companies
                    in Europe and Taiwan based international upcycling company Miniwizan, they are also focussing on
                    transforming various other recyclable materials like glass from electronics into glassware, tables
                    and hangers.4

                    upcoming startup, Emeco, Hannover, Pennsylvania, is a good example of a firm that has been upcycling
                    since a long time. The company has an excellent reputation of using salvaged aluminium since World
                    War II. The full name of the company is Electrical Machine and Equipment Co. and they began
                    operations by employing local sheetworkers to make chairs specifically for sailors and ships. Today,
                    the company is still following its mission to make chairs that survive brutal seas but now catering
                    restaurants, hotels and offices.5

                    The original process to make the chair hasn't changed at all in the past decades. It includes 77
                    steps to make the chair which includes welding soft recycled aluminum, treating the metal to 960
                    degree salt bath and baking the chairs before polishing them thrice by hand. The company claims that
                    its chairs use processes which turn reclaimed materials into furniture products that are almost
                    thrice as strong as chairs made from steel. In order to make their signature 111 Navy Chair the
                    company makes use of truckloads of PET bales on a weekly basis that contain more than 20000 bottles.
                    By following this philosophy they have managed to keep 21 million plastic bottles out of the
                    landfills since 2010 and Emerco says it plans to increase this number. All the products from Emerco
                    come with a buyback guarantee to upcycle the materials again.

                    strides in upcycling is Arhaus Furnitures6 from Cleveland which has various products in its
                    collection that incorporate recycled materials. As a part of their business model Arhaus is sourcing
                    recycled copper from Mexico as a part of its dining room furniture collection by creating sets that
                    have been melted down and molded.7 The process begins with melting the metal itself then it is cured
                    and wood fired and the tops are hand pounded multiple times before being waxed and shined. These
                    copper tables are made in the region of Mexico where Monarch Butterflies annually migrate and to add
                    this touch they emboss the table with the butterfly itself to signify the place. Arhaus furniture is
                    also drawing inspiration from the outdoors and wild by using petrified wood to create innovative
                    designs.

                    is also investing a lot in sustainability domains and is not shying away from going for ambitious
                    targets like a goal which they have set to reach 100 percent recycled materials by 2020 which was
                    hampered by the Pandemic.8Ikea have also committed themselves to using organic cotton for their
                    upholstery as the organic cotton is known to come from farmers that use less water, chemicals and
                    pesticides. Their wood products use a wide range of recycled materials and they are also trying
                    their best to phase out their existing oil based polystyrene in its flat packs and are replacing
                    them with fully recyclable materials. In 2012, Ikea came out with its initiative called People and
                    Planet Positivity Sustainability strategy which included several programs like mattress recycling
                    program and they plan to include more fully recyclable products and inspired collections. With big
                    companies like Ikea coming forward with such initiatives, it is bound to push more and more
