                                        of Homebuilders, the average appliance lasts less than 15 years, although some
                                        have been around for much longer. As per the Guinness World Records, the
                                        Centennial Light Bulb in Livermore, California, was installed in 1901 and is the
                                        world's longest-burning light bulb. The Shelby Electric Company in Ohio created
                                        the hand-blown bulb in the late 1890s, and it was handed to the Livermore Fire
                                        Department in 1901. It was originally a 30-watt light, but since 2010, it has
                                        been running at about 4 watts. According to Guinness, it has been left on 24
                                        hours a day at Fire Station #6 "to provide night illumination to the fire
                                        engines." It has rarely been switched off since its installation in 1901, has
                                        outlived every firefighter of the time, and has been named the ‘Eternal Light’
                                        by General Electric engineers and scientists all around the world. The origins
                                        of the bulb, termed the Centennial Light, raises the question of whether it is a
                                        physics marvel or a hint that modern bulbs are weaker in make and design. Its
                                        long-term viability is still a mystery.

                  <h4>  Historical Perspective</h4>
<br><br>
                    In 1881, Thomas Edison introduced the first commercial bulb, which lasted 1,500 hours, and soon
                    after bulb manufacturers boasted of 2,500-hour bulbs. However, in 1924, the major bulb makers in the
                    United States and Europe secretly created a cartel to limit light life to 1,000 hours. By the 1940s,
                    1,000-hour bulbs had established themselves as the industry norm. The cartel was eventually
                    revealed, and in 1953, General Electric and other industry leaders were prohibited from reducing the
                    life duration of light bulbs. The inventor of the better filament, Adolphe A. Chaillet of the Shelby
                    Electric Company, was granted a patent in 1902, but no information about the filament's structure or
                    composition was published. Thomas Edison has always been credited with inventing the light bulb.
                    Many inventors, on the other hand, have contributed to the advancement of incandescent light bulb
                    technology. Although there is no doubt that Edison, as well as his successor business General
                    Electric, invented the first successful mass-produced incandescent bulb.
                    <br><br>

                    In 1972, a fire marshal in Livermore, California, reported an unusual occurrence to the local paper:
                    a naked Shelby light bulb hanging from the ceiling of his station had been glowing continuously for
                    decades. The bulb had been a legend at the firehouse for years, but no one knew how long it had been
                    burning or where it had come from. Mike Dunstan, a young reporter for the Tri-Valley Herald, started
                    looking into it and what he discovered was simply incredible. Dunstan discovered the bulb's origins
                    after combing through dozens of oral and written documented histories. It was purchased by Dennis
                    Bernal of the Livermore Power and Water Co. (the city's first power company) sometime in the late
                    1890s, then donated to the city's fire department in 1901, when Bernal sold the company. Because
                    only 3% of American houses had electricity at the time, the Shelby bulb was in high demand.
                    <br><br>

                    The ‘Centennial Light’ was moved numerous times during its early life: it hung in a hose cart for a
                    few months, then was secured in Livermore's fire station after a brief spell in a garage and City
                    Hall. “It was left on 24 hours a day to break up the darkness so the volunteers could find their
                    way,” then-Fire Chief Jack Baird told Dustan. “It’s part of another era in the city’s past and it’s
                    served its purpose well.” Despite the fact that it was switched off for "approximately a week when
                    President Roosevelt's WPA team refurbished the firehouse back in the 1930s," Guinness World Records
                    determined that the hand-blown 30-watt bulb was "the oldest glowing light in the world" at 71 years
                    old (presently 121 years old). Following that, it received a flurry of headlines, including
                    appearances on Ripley's Believe It or Not and various news networks. A dedicated webcam allowed the
                    general public to witness the bulb had reportedly burned out on the evening of May 20, 2013. The
                    next morning, an electrician was dispatched to confirm the situation. It was determined that the
                    light had not burned out when the dedicated power supply was bypassed with an extension cable. A
                    problem with the power supply was detected. Before the sun was finally restored, it had been out for
                    about 9 hours and 45 minutes.

                  <br><br>
                    "On September 21, 1908, a stagehand named Barry Burke at the Byers Opera House, Fort Worth, Texas
                    screwed in a new light bulb and it was still burning," according to the Guinness Book of World
                    Records. The Palace Theater was renamed, and the light was known as the Palace Bulb ever since. It's
                    presently on display at the Stockyards Museum, and it'll be 100 years old in September 2008. A
                    website is currently being developed for the Palace Bulb. The third is simply known as ‘the bulb,’
                    and it burns in a firehouse in Mangum, Oklahoma, just like the centennial bulb. It has been in use
                    since roughly 1926, does not require any specific power conversions, and is turned on and off as
                    needed. A light in a lavatory at Martin & Newby Electrical Shop in Ipswich, England, dated from 1930
                    and burned out in January 2001 was the fourth closest in line. The City of Livermore and the
                    Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department plan to keep the Centennial Light Bulb lit as long as possible.
                    They are yet to decide on what action will be taken if and when it burns out. A museum-quality
                    display of historic bulbs, firefighter memorabilia, and a looping video about the Bulb are up and
                    running for now, attracting many out of curiosity, intrigue, and a passion to dwell further on the
                    existing pieces of evidence of the origins of technology.
