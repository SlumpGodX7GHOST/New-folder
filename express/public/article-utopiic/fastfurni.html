                    It is no secret that our current consumer behavior (more, faster, cheaper) is not sustainable. In
                    recent years, farmhouse restaurants and trendy thrift stores have made shopping really interesting.2
                    Why has this trend not been transferred to furniture?

                    of the most exciting things you can do is have a blank canvas that you can use to decorate your
                    home. Many of us turn to the one-click wonders of large retail stores to fill our spaces with
                    seemingly cheaper and easier options.
                    <br><br>
                    But aside from the headache of overwhelming options, unreliable deliveries, and tedious assembly,
                    the reality of mass-produced furniture has an insidious side effect. What we save out of our own
                    pocket is at the expense of the environment. Here's what you need to know and can do to make
                    informed decisions for your home.

                    Furniture is one of the fastest growing landfill categories. Two years ago, the EPA found that
                    furniture in the United States accounted for more than 12 million tons (nearly 5 percent)3 of
                    municipal waste. Waste, as it is not so affectionately known, makes up the second-largest proportion
                    of municipal waste.4
                    <br><br>
                    You have probably seen it yourself when you have walked the streets of the city. Have you ever had
                    to dodge an abandoned sofa or a dismantled bed frame? Sometimes the furniture doesn't even make it
                    to the landfill. Instead, it ends up on the sidewalk like trash.
                    <br><br>
                    Recycling is great in theory, but the mix of materials and chemicals that comprise each item of
                    furniture makes it nearly impossible to process in a recycling facility. For example, particle
                    board—a material commonly found in cheaper furniture—is not recyclable or biodegradable
                    <br><br>
                    because of its chemical resin and plastic laminate. Ultimately, 80 percent of waste goes straight to
                    the dump, making furniture the least recycled household item.

                    <br><br>
                    One percent of all the commercially harvested wood in the world is used by IKEA. This number may
                    sound small, but that's a lot of trees.
                    <br><br>
                    To put it in perspective: 600 tons5 of chipboard is eaten every day to create the world's most
                    popular bookshelf. Particleboard is sometimes considered a green material, as it is often (but not
                    always) made from pieces of wood. In fact, however, production requires more energy as scrap must be
                    shredded, dried, mixed with a chemical glue, heated, and re-pressed to obtain usable sheets.
                    <br><br>
                    Synthetic fibers6 used in furniture are made from fossil fuels, which are also energy intensive to
                    extract and manufacture. Consider the water and energy it takes to run furniture factories and move
                    products around the world, and the carbon footprint of this cheap coffee table is skyrocketing.
                    <br><br>
                    The materials and chemicals used in Fast Furniture not only pollute the environment, but also our
                    bodies. Particleboard often contains formaldehyde7, a carcinogen that can cause health problems if
                    released into the air. Other chemicals that threaten the quality of our air
                    <br><br>
                    and water include certain dyes, scotchgard, leather tanning chemicals, flame retardants,
                    polyurethane foam, adhesives, and varnishes. We spend 90 percent of our time indoors; The last thing
                    we want is a toxin-saturated home.8

                    Did Ariana Grande make an in-depth comment on our contemporary culture of rampant consumerism? Or
                    was she just doing what she does best: putting out another pop hit that you can't get out of your

                    In any case, the pop star sings the truth about today's world of "fast" consumption. With the rise

                <p class="u-text u-text-1" style="padding-top:60px ;"> 1. Buy Less, Waste Less 
<br><br>
                    An easy decision is to buy less, but buy for quality and durability. This can reduce your overall waste footprint and, as we know, any sofa or chair that bypasses the landfill cycle. When you are considering where to invest and how to ensure quality, you can rely on certifications to find sustainably produced furniture.9 
                    <br><br>
                    2. Donate 
                    <br><br>
                    If you want to deliver your furniture, contact non-profit organizations or thrift stores. Take care of your household items, so their value extends beyond your hands. In the Bay Area, partners like Habitat for Humanity ReStore10 and SF Furniture Bank11 offer outlets for discounts on used household items. One less item that goes to the landfill is one less item that needs to be produced and retailed. 
                    <br><br>
                    3. Rent 
                    <br><br>
                    Think of it as the new circular economy for furniture. For all those who do not want to commit to timeless furniture, but also do not want to leave the heavy pressure of carbon furniture behind, furniture subscriptions such as Oliver Space12, Fernish13, Feather14 and more offer the alternative to the conventional waste model. 
                    <br><br>
                    4. Shop Vintage 
                    <br><br>
                    Give even more airtime to timeless pieces. In the Bay Area, find gems at local furniture stores such as Past Perfect15, Harrington Galleries16, and Carousel17. Each worn piece can add personality and style to your interior, while saving you an unnecessary trip to the fast furniture store. Some would say vintage is 'fashionable', we say vintage is ethical and sustainable. 
                    <br><br>
                    We all want to be smart in style and money when we furnish a new space to call ourselves home, but being environmentally conscious is more important than ever. Your sofa will rest much more comfortably, knowing it's a greener choice for the planet.
