                                        the Earth has gone from being almost devoid of junk to being clogged with
                                        man-made items that threaten launches, active satellites, and the International
                                        Space Station (ISS). According to NASA, more than 21,000 particles the size of a
                                        softball were being tracked in 2013, with an estimated 500,000 bits the size of
                                        a marble believed to exist. Over 100 million much smaller things, as little as a
                                        speck of paint, are impossible to detect or track. Around 1,100 active
                                        satellites make up around 6% of all Earth-orbiting objects; the remainder is
                                        garbage. Humans have been exploring space for as long as we can remember,
                                        leading to irreparable consequences. Thousands of dead satellites orbit our
                                        globe, along with bits of debris from all the rockets we have fired throughout
                                        the years. This could become a problem in the future.

                   <h4>WHAT IS SPACE DEBRIS OR SPACE JUNK</h4>
<br><br>
                    Any piece of machinery or debris left by humans in space is known as space junk or space debris. It
                    can refer to large objects like failed or abandoned satellites left in orbit after the mission ends
                    or tiny items such as fragments of debris or paint flecks that have fallen from a rocket. There is
                    also some human-made junk even on the Moon. Debris can also be produced by a space explosion or when
                    countries conduct missile tests to destroy their satellites. Aside from Russia, China, the US, and
                    India have all shot down satellites, resulting in space debris. Due to the high speeds at which
                    space junk orbits the globe - roughly 15,700 miles per hour (25,265 kilometers per hour) in low
                    Earth orbit - it might inflict considerable damage to a satellite or spacecraft in the event of a
                    collision. With the deployment of more satellites from firms like Elon Musk's Starlink and OneWeb
                    satellite constellations, space debris in the vicinity of Earth will undoubtedly increase. According
                    to NASA, In 1996, debris from a French rocket that had exploded a decade earlier struck and
                    destroyed a French satellite. A derelict Russian spacecraft collided with and destroyed a functional
                    US Iridium commercial satellite on February 10, 2009. More than 2,300 pieces of massive, trackable
                    debris and many smaller pieces of debris were added to the inventory of space junk as a result of
                    the collision. China's anti-satellite test in 2007, which used a missile to destroy an old weather
                    satellite, added about 3,500 pieces of massive, trackable debris to the debris problem, as well as
                    many smaller pieces.
                    <br><br>
                   <h4> CONSEQUENCES OF SPACE JUNK</h4>
                    <br><br>
                    <h4>In Space</h4>
                    <br><br>
                    The proliferation of orbital debris causes concerns in space as well as on Earth. If the projected
                    route of a tracked debris object intersects with the path of a rocket launch, the launch may be
                    delayed. A three-minute delay in the launch of an Indian rocket carrying satellites for four foreign
                    countries in late June 2014 was one such incident. Maneuverable satellites can be relocated to
                    escape orbital debris. In the year 2010, more than 100 similar moves were documented. For example,
                    debris tracking revealed in April 2012 that a defunct Russian satellite and NASA's Fermi Gamma-Ray
                    Telescope will cross paths within 30 milliseconds of each other. The thrusters aboard Fermi were
                    used for one second, and the debris missed Fermi by 9.7 kilometers (6 mi). Fermi was out of
                    commission for one hour due to the avoidance maneuver.
                    <br><br>
                    The Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) at Vandenberg Air Force Base keeps track of over 800
                    maneuverable satellites and compares their routes to orbital debris collected by the Space
                    Surveillance Network. When the JSpOC detects a possible collision, they alert NASA, who then
                    notifies the satellite owners. A total of twenty-nine satellite collision avoidance maneuvers were
                    undertaken or aided by NASA in 2013. NASA tracked objects that could collide with a space shuttle
                    from 1988 to 2011. They looked for items whose routes would lead them into a maneuver box enclosing
                    the shuttle that was 2km x 5km x 2km (1.25 mi x 3 mi x 1.25 km). If a collision was foreseen, the
                    shuttle would maneuver to avoid it unless it would interfere with "either major payload or mission
                    objectives." Nine cataloged objects entered the maneuver box of a space shuttle between September
                    1988 and February 1997. In just four of those instances did the shuttle perform a collision
                    avoidance maneuver; in the other five, the maneuver would have interfered with its mission. The
                    first of these maneuvers, carried out in September 1991, avoided colliding with a spent upper stage
                    rocket body from the Soviet Cosmos 955 satellite launch in 1977.
                    <br><br>
                    The International Space Station, too, has had to avoid space junk. The station's livable
                    compartments are protected from debris up to 1 cm (0.4 in. ), but smaller particles can harm other
                    parts of the station, such as the solar panels. In July 2014, space debris tore a 30 cm (12 in.)
                    long rip in a radiator panel's cover sheet. The ISS has performed nineteen collision avoidance
                    maneuvers since 1999. In March and April 2014, two such movements were performed within three weeks
                    to escape debris from two distinct spacecraft. The ISS avoided debris from the Cosmos 2251 satellite
                    on October 27, 2014. The crew aboard the ISS took refuge in the associated Soyuz crew transportation
                    vessel on three previous occasions when the approach of space debris was discovered too late to
                    undertake an avoidance maneuver. Despite these safeguards, numerous components of the ISS have been
                    damaged, including thermal radiators, solar panels, and a window.
                    <br><br>
                   <h4> On the Ground</h4>
                   <br><br>
                    Space debris that falls out of orbit burns up in the atmosphere, but larger fragments can reach the
                    earth intact or in chunks. Every week, on average, one uncontrolled re-entry of a spacecraft or
                    rocket body weighing around 2,000 kg (4,400 lbs) happens. 10–40% of their mass reaches the ground in
                    these cases. Because water covers 70% of the Earth's surface, the majority of the trash ends up in
                    the oceans. Several huge pieces, however, have landed on land. The unplanned re-entry of the US
                    space station Skylab in July 1979 was one famous incident. As it streaked through the atmosphere,
                    the 76,000 kg (84 tonnes) object disintegrated. As the fragments approached the earth, residents in
                    two locations in southwestern Australia heard sonic booms. Debris was strewn across 200 km (125 mi)
                    by 1,000 km (620 mi) area, and more than 500 pieces weighing a total of 20,000 kg (22 tons) were
                    found in the Australian Outback. Due to the increasing potential of collision with and damage to
                    functional satellites, the building of space junk poses a particularly catastrophic threat to
                    humanity's future in space exploration. It may potentially have negative consequences for the
                    Earth's ecosystem.
                    <br><br>
                    <h4>CONTROLLING SPACE DEBRIS</h4>
                    <br><br>
                    The plethora of methods being developed to control space trash can sound more science fiction than
                    reality. The electrodynamic tether is an electronic space whip that runs six football fields long
                    and is being tested by JAXA, Japan's space agency (EDT). The roughly 2,300-foot-long electric cable
                    is capped by a 44-pound weight. It's designed to push trash out of orbit and burn up in Earth's
                    atmosphere after it's deployed. That is by no means the only choice. To safely pare down the
                    expanding debris cloud, other concepts include huge magnets, harpoons, and nets. Many countries are
                    approaching the problem from the other side of the equation, ensuring that any future man-made
                    orbiters dispatched to soar beyond Earth's surface have a proper end-of-life plan in place to
                    restrict the expanding cloud of garbage that engulfs our home planet. The United Nations has
                    requested that all firms de-orbit their satellites within 25 years of their mission's completion.
                    However, because satellites can (and do) fail, this is difficult to enforce. Several companies
                    throughout the world have devised unique strategies to address this issue. Dead satellites are
                    removed from orbit and dragged back into the atmosphere, where they will burn up. Using a harpoon to
                    capture a satellite, catching it in a big net, using magnets to capture it, or even using lasers to
                    heat the satellite and increase its atmospheric drag, causing it to fall out of orbit are all
                    possibilities.
